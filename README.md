# JavaScript Basic Project

### Requirements
1. An HTML file with different inputs - see index.html (text, radio, checkbox, and number). It seems like number lets the user input non-numbers, so I parsed and tried to account for invalid inputs. <br />
2. A JavaScript file that modifies the contents of the webpage: see script.js. <br />
3. Organizing the data into a JSON object: see the storeData() method. <br />
4. Stringifying and storing the data: see the storeData() method. Put into the array "data", so information from different sessions can be stored and organized by date. <br />
5. Redisplaying data: one can choose to display all the data, or only some data based on search constraints. The data is redisplayed with the average calories per meal if there is available data to calculate that. <br />
